/*

This query provides events with TLS version and event source. This query is helpful when you are trying to find
specific version of TLS. Eg: If youâ€™re trying to find events realted to TLSv1 (which will have a end of support on June 28. 2023),
You can include in the filter criteria AND CAST(REPLACE(tlsDetails.tlsVersion, 'TLSv', '') AS DOUBLE) <= 1.1
This filters all TLS connections with 1.1 and below.
